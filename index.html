          <p>
I am a researcher in cognitive and evolutionary anthropology interested in the psychological motivations that shape belief formation, social learning and cultural transmission. I completed my PhD at the University of Oxford under the supervision of Harvey Whitehouse, based at the Centre for the Study of Social Cohesion (CSSC). My doctoral research examined why some cultural practices and beliefs (such as rituals, conventions, norms and traditions) are transmitted with high fidelity and resist change, while others remain flexible and open to innovation.

          <p>
My work integrates experimental psychology, cultural evolutionary theory and computational approaches, with earlier training in cognitive neuroscience using EEG and pupillometry.

          </p>
          <p>
My current research focuses on the social and affiliative functions of belief systems, norm enforcement and the conditions under which cultural practices become stable, moralised and resistant to correction.
