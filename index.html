    <div class="bio">
      <p>
        I am a researcher in social psychology and evolutionary anthropology interested in the motivations that guide belief formation, social learning and cultural transmission. I completed my PhD at the University of Oxford under the supervision of <a href="https://www.harveywhitehouse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof Harvey Whitehouse</a>, based at the <a href="https://www.cssc.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Centre for the Study of Social Cohesion (CSSC)</a>. My doctoral research examined why some cultural practices and beliefs (such as rituals, conventions, norms and traditions) are transmitted with high fidelity and resist change, while others remain flexible and open to innovation.
      </p>
 <p>
I am equally interested in supernatural and conspiratorial belief systems, the social cognition underlying moral norms and the evolution of morality as a cooperative device. Across these domains, my work asks how beliefs that are weakly supported by direct evidence can nonetheless become socially compelling, morally charged and resistant to correction.
 </p>
      <p>
        My work integrates experimental psychology, cultural evolutionary theory and computational approaches, with earlier training in cognitive neuroscience using EEG and pupillometry.

        The transmission of rituals and magical practices is a fundamental feature of human culture, yet the psychological mechanisms underpinning their persistence remain contested. The Bifocal Stance Theory (BST; Jagiello et al., 2022a; Whitehouse, 2021) posits that individuals adopt either a ritual stance, which prioritizes social affiliation and norm adherence, or an instrumental stance, which emphasizes efficiency in achieving goal-directed outcomes. We hypothesize that actions can be viewed by social learners through the lens of either stance depending on a variety of contextual cues. To test this hypothesis, we employed an online adaptation of the pen-and-cups paradigm (Leighton et al., 2010), in which participants repeatedly observed and reproduced modelled actions. They were randomly assigned to one of four conditions (clear, expert, magic or ritual), systematically manipulating verbal frames, causal opacity, goal demotion, and the resolvability of opacity (i.e. whether the causal structure was in principle knowable). Crucially, we investigated whether social exclusion also influences imitative fidelity. Our findings provide the first experimental evidence that individuals experiencing ostracism exhibit higher copying fidelity for actions that are causally opaque in irresovable ways compared to instrumental and resolvable ones. These results support the view that when actions are interpreted and transmitted as “rituals” and “magic”, they serve social and affiliative functions, reinforcing group cohesion and cooperation rather than merely supporting the transmission of technically useful information. Moreover, our findings challenge and extend existing accounts of cultural learning which argue that cultural transmission is primarily a matter of instrumentally directed learning. We argue that integrating both affiliative and instrumental perspectives is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the psychological foundations of cultural learning.

        Cultural evolution depends on both innovation (the creation of new cultural variants by accident
or design) and high-fidelity transmission (which preserves our accumulated knowledge
and allows the storage of normative conventions). What is required is an overarching theory
encompassing both dimensions, specifying the psychological motivations and mechanisms
involved. The bifocal stance theory (BST) of cultural evolution proposes that the co-existence
of innovative change and stable tradition results from our ability to adopt different motivational
stances flexibly during social learning and transmission. We argue that the ways in
which instrumental and ritual stances are adopted in cultural transmission influence the
nature and degree of copying fidelity and thus also patterns of cultural spread and stability
at a population level over time. BST creates a unifying framework for interpreting the findings
of otherwise seemingly disparate areas of enquiry, including social learning, cumulative culture,
overimitation, and ritual performance. We discuss the implications of BST for competing
by-product accounts which assume that faithful copying is merely a side-effect of instrumental
learning and action parsing. We also set out a novel “cultural action framework” bringing to
light aspects of social learning that have been relatively neglected by behavioural ecologists
and evolutionary psychologists and establishing a roadmap for future research on this
topic. The BST framework sheds new light on the cognitive underpinnings of cumulative cultural
change, selection, and spread within an encompassing evolutionary framework.

        The Bifocal Stance Theory (BST) of cultural evolution has prompted a wide ranging discussion with
broadly three aims: to apply the theory to novel contexts; to extend the conceptual framework; to
offer critical feedback on various aspects of the theory. We first discuss BST’s relevance to the diverse
range of topics which emerged from the commentaries, followed by a consideration of how our
framework can be supplemented by and compared to other theories. Lastly, the criticisms that were
raised by a subset of commentaries allow us to clarify parts of our theory.
