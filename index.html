  <div class="about">

    <div class="bio">
      <p>
        I am a researcher in social psychology and evolutionary anthropology interested in the motivations that guide belief formation, social learning and cultural transmission. I completed my PhD at the University of Oxford under the supervision of <a href="https://www.harveywhitehouse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof Harvey Whitehouse</a>, based at the <a href="https://www.cssc.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Centre for the Study of Social Cohesion (CSSC)</a>. My doctoral research examined why some cultural practices and beliefs (such as rituals, conventions, norms and traditions) are transmitted with high fidelity and resist change, while others remain flexible and open to innovation.
      </p>
 <p>
I am equally interested in supernatural and conspiratorial belief systems, the social cognition underlying moral norms and the evolution of morality as a cooperative device. Across these domains, my work asks how beliefs that are weakly supported by direct evidence can nonetheless become socially compelling, morally charged and resistant to correction.
 </p>
      <p>
        My work integrates experimental psychology, cultural evolutionary theory and computational approaches, with earlier training in cognitive neuroscience using EEG and pupillometry.

        The transmission of rituals and magical practices is a fundamental feature of human culture, yet the psychological mechanisms underpinning their persistence remain contested. The Bifocal Stance Theory (BST; Jagiello et al., 2022a; Whitehouse, 2021) posits that individuals adopt either a ritual stance, which prioritizes social affiliation and norm adherence, or an instrumental stance, which emphasizes efficiency in achieving goal-directed outcomes. We hypothesize that actions can be viewed by social learners through the lens of either stance depending on a variety of contextual cues. To test this hypothesis, we employed an online adaptation of the pen-and-cups paradigm (Leighton et al., 2010), in which participants repeatedly observed and reproduced modelled actions. They were randomly assigned to one of four conditions (clear, expert, magic or ritual), systematically manipulating verbal frames, causal opacity, goal demotion, and the resolvability of opacity (i.e. whether the causal structure was in principle knowable). Crucially, we investigated whether social exclusion also influences imitative fidelity. Our findings provide the first experimental evidence that individuals experiencing ostracism exhibit higher copying fidelity for actions that are causally opaque in irresovable ways compared to instrumental and resolvable ones. These results support the view that when actions are interpreted and transmitted as “rituals” and “magic”, they serve social and affiliative functions, reinforcing group cohesion and cooperation rather than merely supporting the transmission of technically useful information. Moreover, our findings challenge and extend existing accounts of cultural learning which argue that cultural transmission is primarily a matter of instrumentally directed learning. We argue that integrating both affiliative and instrumental perspectives is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the psychological foundations of cultural learning.

Previous research suggests that the imitation of causally opaque behaviour – a fundamental feature of cultural transmission and evolution in humans – is an outcome of two distinct orientations to social learning. One orientation, dubbed the instrumental stance, triggers expectations of learning technically useful skills from more expert models. The other, dubbed the ritual stance, triggers expectations of learning socially useful conventions facilitating affiliation with a group. When adopting the instrumental stance, learners seek out the most efficient causal pathways to well-defined end-goals, jettisoning irrelevant behaviours if it becomes clear that they are redundant. By contrast, learners adopting the ritual stance are less focused on efficiency in achieving end-goals and copy all modelled actions with high fidelity, especially when anxious about exclusion (e.g., when ostracism threat is present). Here we present the results of two experiments showing that supernatural concepts are more readily viewed through the lens of the ritual than the instrumental stance when presented in social settings. These findings have important implications for the evolutionary origins of religion.       </p>

        Cultural evolution depends on both innovation (the creation of new cultural variants by accident
or design) and high-fidelity transmission (which preserves our accumulated knowledge
and allows the storage of normative conventions). What is required is an overarching theory
encompassing both dimensions, specifying the psychological motivations and mechanisms
involved. The bifocal stance theory (BST) of cultural evolution proposes that the co-existence
of innovative change and stable tradition results from our ability to adopt different motivational
stances flexibly during social learning and transmission. We argue that the ways in
which instrumental and ritual stances are adopted in cultural transmission influence the
nature and degree of copying fidelity and thus also patterns of cultural spread and stability
at a population level over time. BST creates a unifying framework for interpreting the findings
of otherwise seemingly disparate areas of enquiry, including social learning, cumulative culture,
overimitation, and ritual performance. We discuss the implications of BST for competing
by-product accounts which assume that faithful copying is merely a side-effect of instrumental
learning and action parsing. We also set out a novel “cultural action framework” bringing to
light aspects of social learning that have been relatively neglected by behavioural ecologists
and evolutionary psychologists and establishing a roadmap for future research on this
topic. The BST framework sheds new light on the cognitive underpinnings of cumulative cultural
change, selection, and spread within an encompassing evolutionary framework.

        The Bifocal Stance Theory (BST) of cultural evolution has prompted a wide ranging discussion with
broadly three aims: to apply the theory to novel contexts; to extend the conceptual framework; to
offer critical feedback on various aspects of the theory. We first discuss BST’s relevance to the diverse
range of topics which emerged from the commentaries, followed by a consideration of how our
framework can be supplemented by and compared to other theories. Lastly, the criticisms that were
raised by a subset of commentaries allow us to clarify parts of our theory.

        Human listeners exhibit marked sensitivity to familiar music, perhaps most readily revealed by popular
“name that tune” games, in which listeners often succeed in recognizing a familiar song based on
extremely brief presentation. In this work, we used electroencephalography (EEG) and pupillometry
to reveal the temporal signatures of the brain processes that allow differentiation between a familiar,
well liked, and unfamiliar piece of music. In contrast to previous work, which has quantified gradual
changes in pupil diameter (the so-called “pupil dilation response”), here we focus on the occurrence of
pupil dilation events. This approach is substantially more sensitive in the temporal domain and allowed
us to tap early activity with the putative salience network. Participants (N = 10) passively listened to
snippets (750 ms) of a familiar, personally relevant and, an acoustically matched, unfamiliar song,
presented in random order. A group of control participants (N = 12), who were unfamiliar with all of the
songs, was also tested. We reveal a rapid differentiation between snippets from familiar and unfamiliar
songs: Pupil responses showed greater dilation rate to familiar music from 100–300 ms post-stimulusonset,
consistent with a faster activation of the autonomic salience network. Brain responses measured
with EEG showed a later differentiation between familiar and unfamiliar music from 350 ms post onset.
Remarkably, the cluster pattern identified in the EEG response is very similar to that commonly found
in the classic old/new memory retrieval paradigms, suggesting that the recognition of brief, randomly
presented, music snippets, draws on similar processes.

        Social diffusion of information amplifies risk through processes of birth, death, and distortion
of message content. Dread risk—involving uncontrollable, fatal, involuntary, and
catastrophic outcomes (e.g., terrorist attacks and nuclear accidents)—may be particularly
susceptible to amplification because of the psychological biases inherent in dread risk avoidance.
To test this, initially balanced information about high or low dread topics was given to
a set of individuals who then communicated this information through diffusion chains, each
person passing a message to the next. A subset of these chains were also reexposed to the
original information. We measured prior knowledge, perceived risk before and after transmission,
and, at each link, number of positive and negative statements. Results showed that
the more a message was transmitted the more negative statements it contained. This was highest
for the high dread topic. Increased perceived risk and production of negative messages was
closely related to the amount of negative information that was received, with domain knowledge
mitigating this effect. Reexposure to the initial information was ineffectual in reducing
bias, demonstrating the enhanced danger of socially transmitted information.
